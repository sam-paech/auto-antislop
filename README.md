# Auto-Antislop

Auto-Antislop is an automated pipeline designed to iteratively refine text generation datasets and finetune language models to reduce "slop" ‚Äì common, repetitive, or undesirable phrases and patterns often found in LLM outputs. It combines generation, analysis, and DPO/FTPO (Direct Preference Optimization / Final Token Preference Optimization) finetuning into a configurable workflow.

The core idea is to:
1.  Generate text using a base model.
2.  Analyze this text against a human baseline and its own patterns to identify "slop."
3.  Automatically create ban lists (n-grams, phrases, regex).
4.  Re-generate text, this time actively preventing the generation of banned phrases/n-grams identified in the earlier step using antislop backtracking.
5.  Optionally repeat analysis / antislop generation / ban list updates for several iterations.
6.  Create a preference dataset constituting examples of the inference so far, plus a `rejected` continuation token and several `chosen` alternate continuation tokens.
7.  Finetune the base model on this preference dataset using DPO or FTPO.

## üåü Key Features

*   **Detailed Output & Metrics:** Saves analysis results, ban lists, and performance metrics for each iteration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Pipeline Flow)

1.  **(Optional) vLLM Server Management:** If `manage_vllm` is true, the script starts a vLLM server. If a server is already running on the configured port, or if `manage_vllm` is false, the script assumes an external vLLM server.
2.  **Iteration Loop (`num_iterations` times):**
    *   **Generation (Iter 0 - Baseline):**
        *   The `antislop-vllm` script generates text from a source dataset (e.g., writing prompts) *without* any ban lists active. This forms the "rejected" data for DPO.
    *   **Analysis (All Iterations):**
        *   The generated text is analyzed using tools from `slop-forensics` and custom analysis scripts:
            *   N-gram frequencies are compared against a human writing profile.
            *   Over-represented words are identified.
            *   Common "slop phrases" are extracted.
        *   Metrics like lexical diversity (TTR, RTTR) and repetition scores are calculated.
    *   **Ban List Update (All Iterations):**
        *   Based on the analysis, n-gram and slop phrase ban lists are created or updated. User-supplied `extra_ngrams_to_ban`, `extra_slop_phrases_to_ban`, and `extra_regex_patterns` from the config are merged.
    *   **Generation (Iter 1+ - Anti-Slop):**
        *   `antislop-vllm` generates text again, but this time it uses the accumulated ban lists (n-grams, slop phrases, regex) to guide generation away from undesirable content.
        *   The output of the final iteration serves as the "chosen" data for DPO.
3.  **DPO/FTPO Dataset Creation:**
    *   Pairs are created:
        *   `prompt`: The original input prompt.
        *   `chosen`: Generation from the *final* anti-slop iteration.
        *   `rejected`: Generation from the *initial* baseline iteration (Iter 0).
    *   For FTPO mode, a specialized dataset is created focusing on single-token choices where the model was guided away from a "bad" token.
4.  **(Optional) DPO/FTPO Finetuning:**
    *   If `finetune_enabled` is true, the script runs DPO or FTPO finetuning using the preference dataset.
    *   Supports LoRA and optional 4-bit quantization (QLoRA via Unsloth or bitsandbytes).
    *   Saves the LoRA adapters and optionally a merged 16-bit model.
5.  **(Optional) vLLM Server Shutdown:** If the script started vLLM, it stops it.

## üöÄ Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Python 3.9+
    *   NVIDIA GPU with CUDA installed (for vLLM and finetuning).
    *   Git.

2.  **Clone the Repository (with submodules):**
    ```bash
    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/your-username/auto-antislop.git
    cd auto-antislop
    ```
    If you've already cloned without submodules, run:
    ```bash
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *   **Note on vLLM & Torch:** `vllm` and `torch` are listed in `requirements.txt` but commented out. It's often best to install versions compatible with your specific CUDA setup.
        *   If you plan to use the `--manage-vllm` feature, install `vllm` (e.g., `pip install vllm`).
        *   Ensure PyTorch is installed with CUDA support (see [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/)).
        *   Unsloth (for finetuning) will install its required torch version if not present or incompatible.

4.  **NLTK Data:**
    The script will attempt to download necessary NLTK resources (`punkt`, `punkt_tab`, `stopwords`) on first run. If this fails due to network issues, you might need to download them manually:
    ```python
    import nltk
    nltk.download('punkt')
    nltk.download('punkt_tab') # For NLTK 3.9+
    nltk.download('stopwords')
    ```

4.  **Resuming Runs:**
    If the pipeline is interrupted, you can resume it by providing the path to the experiment directory:
    ```bash
    python main.py --config-file path/to/your_config.yaml --resume-from-dir results/auto_antislop_runs/run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
    ```
    The script will attempt to pick up from the last successfully completed part of the iteration. Generation for an iteration is considered complete if the output JSONL file exists and contains the expected number of `prompt_id`s.

## üìÇ Output Structure

Outputs are saved in `experiment_base_dir` (e.g., `results/auto_antislop_runs/`), under a timestamped directory for each run (e.g., `run_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/`):

```bash
python test_inference.py
```
This script automatically searches for the most recent `merged_16bit` model in the standard output directories. You can modify the prompt within the script.

##üß© Submodules

    *   Handles the core text generation using vLLM.
    *   Crucially, it implements the logic for dynamic banning of n-grams, phrases, and regex patterns during the generation process.
*   **`slop-forensics`**: (Path: `slop-forensics/`)
    *   Provides tools and algorithms for analyzing text to identify various types of "slop," including over-represented n-grams and common undesirable phrases.


### üìñ FTPO explained

FTPO (Final-Token Preference Optimisation) is a narrow-scope preference-training step that only touches the single next-token position and avoids training on the preceding context. The intent is to push probability mass **away from the first token of a banned phrase (the *rejected* token)** and **toward one or more viable alternatives (the *chosen* tokens)** while leaving the rest of the model distribution largely intact.

---

#### 1. How a training example is created

1. **Generation runs with banning active.**
   In the auto-antislop pipeline, the FTPO dataset is generated in iterations > 0, when antislop is actively banning slop that it surfaced during the first iteration. Whenever the sampler encounters a banned n-gram / phrase / regex, it halts and constructs a training example before resuming inference with a non-banned continuation.

2. **Rejected token.**
   The would-have-been next token (the first token of the banned phrase) is stored as the `rejected` continuation token.

3. **Chosen tokens.**
   The sampler then draws further candidates for that same position, applying a *min-p* filter ¬π to keep only continuations whose tail probability mass is above a given threshold, to ensure they are coherent. These candidates are further filtered per the banned phrases list. The remaining tokens are stored as the `chosen` continuation tokens in the sample.

   * If no alternative passes the filter the event is discarded and no FTPO sample is written.

4. **Context.**
   The full prompt (and any chat template markers) up to but **not including** the banned token is stored.
   This means the model receives identical context for both the rejected and chosen tokens.

Result: a single JSONL line contains the shared context plus one rejected token and a small set of chosen tokens ‚Äî exactly the information FTPO needs.

---

#### 2. Loss formulation

* **Preference term.**
  For each example the trainer computes
  `Œî = logit(chosen) ‚àí logit(rejected)` (or the equivalent in probability space).
  The loss is `‚àílog œÉ(Œ≤ Œî)` in ‚Äúfree‚Äù mode or a clipped variant in ‚Äúclip‚Äù mode. Or in plain English, the amount that all the chosen logits are beating the rejected, averaged across chosen tokens for that sample.
  This encourages the model to rank *every* chosen token above the rejected one.
  Once a chosen logit is beating rejected by a given margin, it no longer contributes to the loss. This helps to avoid unnecessarily moving the weights when chosen is already winning.

* **Two-part KL regulariser.**
  A key part of the loss function is the KL loss, which is split into two terms:

  ```
  Œª_kl ¬∑ KL_non-target + Œª_kl_target ¬∑ KL_target
  ```

  Where "target" refers to the chosen & rejected logits.

   ‚Äì **KL\_target**: We need the target logits to move significantly, in order to suppress the top "slop" logit and let the other candidates win. So they cannot be naively constrained to the reference, like they would be with ordinary KL loss. Instead, we define this `kl_target` term as the *mean* divergence from reference of the chosen + rejected set. This allows these logits more freedom to move relative to each other, while still being overall anchored to the reference.
   The target logits are also allowed some grace to move before kl loss kicks in, per the `tau_kl_target` parameter. So small logit shifts in the target tokens are free but large shifts are penalised quadratically.
   ‚Äì **KL\_non-target**: This loss term applies exclusively to the rest of the vocabulary (all tokens not in {chosen ‚à™ rejected}). This is the traditional kl loss idea from DPO which constrains those logits to the reference.

  This split lets the model reorder the chosen/rejected logits relative to each other while avoiding unwanted drift elsewhere.


Add the following block just after the **Loss formulation** section.


#### 3. FTPO Tunable hyper-parameters

* **`loss_mode`**
  `"clip"` (default) or `"free"`.

  * **clip** ‚Äì applies the epsilon thresholds below so that, once a chosen token is comfortably ahead of the rejected one, its contribution to the loss is capped.
  * **free** ‚Äì uses the raw `‚àílog œÉ(Œ≤ Œî)` everywhere; stronger gradients but higher risk of overshooting.

* **`beta`** *(float, default 0.1)*
  Scales the preference term. Smaller values dampen gradients; larger values make the model push logit differences more aggressively.

* **`LOSS_CALC_MODE`**
  `"logits"` (default) or `"probs"`.

  * **logits** ‚Äì works directly in logit space; only the local logits move, leaving the softmax normalisation unchanged for the rest of the vocab.
  * **probs** ‚Äì converts to probabilities first; gentler, but every token‚Äôs prob is indirectly affected by the softmax.

* **`clip_epsilon_logits`** *(float, default 2)*
  When in `"logits"` mode and `loss_mode="clip"`, the loss stops growing once `logit(chosen) ‚àí logit(rejected)` exceeds this value.

* **`clip_epsilon_probs`** *(float, default 0.2)*
  Analogous threshold for `"probs"` mode, defined on probability differences.

* **`lambda_kl`** *(float, default 0.4)*
  Weight of **KL\_non-target** ‚Äì keeps all *other* vocabulary logits near the reference model.

* **`lambda_kl_target`** *(float, default 0.1)*
  Weight of **KL\_target** ‚Äì steadies the *mean* of the chosen + rejected set.

* **`tau_kl_target`** *(float, default 2.0)*
  Grace band for **KL\_target**. Shifts of ‚â§ `tau_kl_target` are free; beyond that the quadratic penalty kicks in.

 

---

#### 3. Why this matches Auto-Antislop‚Äôs goal

* Banning logic already identifies *precisely* which token is undesirable; FTPO acts at that same granularity.
* Because the rest of the vocabulary is regularised, stylistic and semantic behaviour outside the specific slop token is preserved.
* The min-p filter ensures that only alternatives likely to form coherent continuations are rewarded, so the model learns ‚Äúchoose a sensible non-slop word here‚Äù rather than ‚Äúchoose any rare tail token‚Äù.

## üí° Notes & Troubleshooting

*   **GPU Memory:** Running vLLM and finetuning (especially with larger models) requires significant GPU VRAM. Adjust `vllm_gpu_memory_utilization` and finetuning batch sizes/quantization accordingly. If running both on the same GPU, the script attempts to stop vLLM before finetuning to free up VRAM.
*   **Submodule Issues:** If you encounter errors related to `antislop-vllm` or `slop-forensics`, ensure the submodules are correctly initialized (`git submodule update --init --recursive`).
*   **NLTK Data:** If `ensure_core_nltk_resources()` fails, download the resources manually as described in Installation.
*   **Unsloth Cache:** Unsloth might create a `unsloth_compiled_cache` directory. This is ignored by git.
*   **Gemma-3 Checkpoints:** The `utils/model_helpers.py` contains a `fix_gemma3_checkpoint` function to handle potential inconsistencies in Gemma-3 model key naming, and `detie_lm_head` to ensure proper saving of merged models.
*   **FTPO Mode:** The "ftpo" (Final Token Preference Optimization) mode uses `FTPOTrainer` which focuses on the preference for a single next token, given a context. This is useful for correcting specific token choices rather than entire continuations.
