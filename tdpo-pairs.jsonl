Your response:\n<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\nThe rain tasted of rust and regret. It always did now, a fine, gritty drizzle that coated everything in a dull, ochre sheen. I pulled my threadbare scarf tighter around my face, trying to block out the wind whistling through the skeletal remains of what used to be Denver. Thirty years. Thirty years since the sky ripped open and spat fire, since the world fractured and bled into a monochrome nightmare. Thirty years since the last decent cup of coffee. \n\nAnd thirty years since I won a lifetime supply of Oreos. \n\nIt started with a cereal box. I was eight, a skinny, freckled kid obsessed with anything vaguely sugary. The prize was a flimsy plastic trophy proclaiming “World’s Best Reader,” and nestled beneath it, a cardboard box overflowing with the iconic black and white cookies. My parents, bless their pragmatic souls, had scoffed at the idea of a lifetime supply, but the shipping company, a surprisingly resilient entity named “Sweet Deliveries,” insisted. A legal clause, they’d mumbled about contingencies and unforeseen circumstances. It was, they’d said with a weary politeness, “a very unusual deal.”\n\nNow, every month, without fail, a crate – always a crate – materialized. It would appear on the rusted-out porch of my current shelter, a small, improbable oasis of normalcy in a world drowning in ash and silence.
